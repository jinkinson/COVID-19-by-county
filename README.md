# COVID-19-by-county
Data updated daily on the number of COVID-19 cases in each county in the US (from the NYT) combined with the population of each county (from the US Census's 2019 estimates), and the per capita number of cases/deaths for each county based on both of these.

NYT data was extracted from the NYT's GitHub dataset using the COVID-data-nyt.py script outlined in my "geographic" repository here: https://github.com/jinkinson/geographic The NYT dataset in question can be obtained here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv

US Census county population data for 2019 (most recent available year) obtained from here: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html
